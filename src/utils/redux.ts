 * Creates an action factory with an async preparation function.
 *
 * The preparation function will be called with all the arguments that were
 * originally passed to the action factory. It must then return a promise, which
 * will be dispatched to Redux with the given action name. The Redux middleware
 * will take care of dispatching appropriate actions that notify the store about
 * the progress of the execution of the promise.
 *
 * @param name - The name of the action to dispatch
 * @param prepare - The async function that the action will execute and
 *                  whose promise will be dispatched to Redux
 * @param minDelay - Minimum delay between the start and the end of the
 *                   execution of the promise. Used to get rid of annoying UI
 *                   glitches when it would not be desired to show a progress
 *                   indicator for a very short-lived action
