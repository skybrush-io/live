/**
 * Mapping from known job types to the async functions that handle them.
 *
 * Each entry in this map consists of:
 *
 * - `type`: the type of the job, i.e. a unique string identifier
 * - `title`: the title of the job, used in dialog boxes
 * - `scope`: the scope of the job, i.e. the set of UAVs that the job can
 *   operate on. Must be one of `mission` (UAVs that are in the current mission
 *   mapping), `all` (all UAVs, irrespectively of whether they are mapped in
 *   the current mission or not) or `single` (single selected UAV in the UAs
 *   list). The default is `all`. Use the `JobScope` enum when referring to
 *   these strings from code.
 * - `selector`: a Redux selector that is called before executing the job for a
 *   single UAV. The selector is called with the Redux state and the ID of the
 *   UAV that the job is targeting, and it can return an arbitrary object that
 *   will be forwarded to the executor (see below in the `executor` for more
 *   details).
 * - `executor`: an asynchronous function or saga that executes the job for a
 *   single UAV (e.g., uploads a drone show specification to a single UAV). This
 *   function runs in the context of a worker saga, which is blocked until the
 *   promise returned from the executor resolves or rejects. The function will
 *   be called with an object having three keys: `uavId` is the ID of the UAV
 *   that is targeted by the job, `payload` is the payload of the original job
 *   specification, and `data` is the state slice that was extracted by the
 *   selector associated to the job type. The semantics of the payload and the
 *   data object depends solely on the type of the job being executed.
 *
 * It is recommended to use an executor _saga_ or to make the executor return a
 * _cancellable_ promise to facilitate the cancellation of uploads.
 *
 * Additionally, each entry may contain:
 *
 * - `workerManager`: a saga that should be responsible for the top-level
 *   scheduling of the tasks in the job, related to the individual UAVs.
 *   The saga takes two parameters: the specification from this map and the
 *   current job (consisting of a type and a payload). The executor defaults
 *   to `forkingWorkerManagementSaga`.
 *
 * You can register new entries in this map from other modules with
 * `registerUploadJobType()`.
